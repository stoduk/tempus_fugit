    """Raspberry Pi time lapse daemon

    Designed to be run at startup on a Raspberry Pi running a MoPi power
    monitor - such that we will be started once the RPi is up and running,
    we'll do our work, and then ask MoPi to turn RPi off and wake up again
    later.  Much like a hardware cron job.

    This is designed with a network-unattahed RPi model A running off batteries
    - this will give the longest possible battery life for our time lapse, but
    to get sane dates on the photos we'll want a hardware RTC connected too.

    The device is likely to be run remotely to the person who knows how to fix
    it, so the aim is that everything can be run without needing an attached
    monitor or any great intelligence.  The device will snap pictures away
    at the configured times, and when a USB drive is plugged in it will update
    itself and copy off any photos taken.  Nice and simple.

    The work to do on each power up is:
    - if a USB drive is found, copy over any new configuration
     (this is useful as we are running remotely and not network connected)
    - take a photo!
    - if a USB drive is found, copy off any photos and log files (eg. to
     indicate power state)

The time lapse module will sit there and turn itself on once every 1/2 hour
between sunrise and sunset, snapping a picture each time.

If a USB drive is found when the camera powers on (manually or due to its
timer) then photos will be copied off (as well as doing any necessary
house keeping)

If the time lapse is turned on manually then it will do any house keeping
necessary (archive images, delete "seen" images, update config, etc.) but will
not ordinarily take a photo.

1) Setup
- this assumes all scripts are already installed
- create a config file, see here for a sample:
  https://github.com/stoduk/tempus_fugit/blob/master/tempus_fugitd.cfg
- save the config file in the root of the USB drive, with the name
  %s
- insert the USB drive, power on the camera

2) Changing batteries
Any time the batteries are disconnected from the camera this will make the
camera forget to turn itself on again.  So after the batteries are
disconnected the camera should be powered on so that the right decisions
and scheduling can be done.

It is safe to turn the camera on manually at any time, the only impact is on
the battery levels!

3) Archiving photos
The camera stores photos to its local storge, but will copy them off whenever
a USB drive is inserted.  It will *not* delete the locally stored files until
it is told to do so - this should only be done once the photos have been copied
elsewhere (eg. uploaded to Flickr) to avoid photo loss.

- any time a USB drive is present when the camera is powered on (either from
its timer or manually) then it will copy across as many photos as it can.

- once the photos on the USB drive have been archived elsewhere, the camera
can be told to delete them.  This is done by renaming the file named
  %s
to
  %s

3) Debugging
If the following magic files exist then certain behaviour is forced - this
will mostly be for debugging purposes, or initial setup testing:

a) %s
If this file exists on the USB drive then the camera will not shut down after
its work is done.  Only needed for debugging.

b) %s
If this file exists on the USB drive then it forces the camera to take a
photo even if it doesn't think it is time

c) %s
This will contain syslog from the camera, useful for debugging problems.

        We force the manual step to avoid the case where a USB drive remains
        plugged in but somehow gets corrupted - we don't want to remove
        the local copy of files until we are sure the files on the USB drive
        have been seen and verified.

        So basically we create a file in the target directory containing
        (a pickled) list of files that have been copied - when the user has
        checked these copied correctly they can rename that file to have all
        photos referenced in it deleted.  Obviously the names of the original
        and renamed pickle files are well known.
